<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is inspired by LoFi Girl of YouTube fame. I listened to that channel during many study sessions during Bootcamp. It set the mood I needed to remain calm and focused during stressful coding assignments. This project's purpose is to practice the skills learned in class in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a project that shows my personality. This project has inspired me to learn more about developing and designing websites.

I used my graphic design skills to customize a licensed vector graphic to represent LoFi Girl. Staying on theme, the music player contains ten royalty-free songs that I licensed from Envato Elements. Each one is of the LoFi genre and no more than 85 BPM. I customized the audio player controls, manipulated many DOM elements, and styled the CSS to match my brand identity.
